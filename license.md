# Contribution
Patches to fix mistakes or add optional content are always appreciated. If you want to see changes on the default content of the training we are open for suggestions but keep in mind that the training is intended for a two day hands-on training.

The rendered content will be updated at least if we do a newer version of the material which will also be tagged on git.
